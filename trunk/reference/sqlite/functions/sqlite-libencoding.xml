  <para>
   The SQLite library may be compiled in either ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8
   compatible modes.  This function allows you to determine which encoding
   scheme is used by your version of the library.
  </para>
  <warning>
   <para>
    The default PHP distribution builds libsqlite in ISO-8859-1 encoding
    mode.  However, this is a misnomer; rather than handling ISO-8859-1, it
    operates according to your current locale settings for string
    comparisons and sort ordering.  So, rather than ISO-8859-1, you should
    think of it as being '8-bit' instead.
   </para>
  </warning>
  <para>
   When compiled with UTF-8 support, sqlite handles encoding and decoding
   of UTF-8 multi-byte character sequences, but does not yet do a complete
   job when working with the data (no normalization is performed for
   example), and some comparison operations may still not be carried out
   correctly.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is not recommended that you use PHP in a web-server configuration
   with a version of the SQLite library compiled with UTF-8 support, since
   libsqlite will abort the process if it detects a problem with the
   UTF-8 encoding.
