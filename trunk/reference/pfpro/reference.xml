    This extension allows you to process credit cards and other financial
    transactions using Verisign Payment Services, formerly known as Signio
    (<ulink url="&url.pfpro;">&url.pfpro;</ulink>).
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    These functions are only available if PHP has been compiled with the
    <option role="configure">--with-pfpro[=DIR]</option> option. You will
    require the appropriate SDK for your platform, which may be
    downloaded <ulink url="&url.pfpro.download;">from within the manager
    interface</ulink> once you have registered. If you are going to use this
	extension in an SSL-enabled webserver or with other SSL components (such as
	the CURL+SSL extension) you MUST get the beta SDK.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Once you have downloaded the SDK you should copy the files from
    the <filename class="directory">lib</filename> directory of the
    distribution. Copy the header file <filename>pfpro.h</filename>
    to <filename class="directory">/usr/local/include</filename>
    and the library file <filename>libpfpro.so</filename> to
    <filename class="directory">/usr/local/lib</filename>.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    When using these functions, you may omit calls to
    <function>pfpro_init</function> and <function>pfpro_cleanup</function>
    as this extension will do so automatically if required. However the
    functions are still available in case you are processing a number of
    transactions and require fine control over the library.
    You may perform any number
    of transactions using <function>pfpro_process</function> between the two.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    These functions were added in PHP 4.0.2.
   </simpara>

   <note><para>
    These functions only provide a link to Verisign Payment Services. Be sure
    to read the Payflow Pro Developers Guide for full details of the required
    parameters.
