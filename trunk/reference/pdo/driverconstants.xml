 The constants below are defined by this driver, and will only be available
 when the extension has been either compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at
 runtime.  In addition, these driver specific constants should only be used if
 you are using this driver.  Using mysql specific attributes into the postgres
 driver may result in unexpected behaviour.
 You can use <function>PDO::getAttribute</function> to obtain the
 <constant>PDO_ATTR_DRIVER_NAME</constant> attribute to check the driver, if
 your code can run against multiple drivers.
