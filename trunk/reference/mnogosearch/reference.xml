     These functions allow you to access the mnoGoSearch (former
     UdmSearch) free search engine. mnoGoSearch is a full-featured search
     engine software for intranet and internet servers, distributed under the
     GNU license. mnoGoSearch has a number of unique features, which makes it
     appropriate for a wide range of applications from search within your
     site to a specialized search system such as cooking recipes or newspaper
     search, FTP archive search, news articles search, etc. It offers
     full-text indexing and searching for HTML, PDF, and text documents.
     mnoGoSearch consists of two parts. The first is an indexing mechanism
     (indexer). The purpose of the indexer is to walk through HTTP, FTP, NEWS
     servers or local files, recursively grabbing all the documents and
     storing meta-data about that documents in a SQL database in a smart and
     effective manner. After every document is referenced by its
     corresponding URL, meta-data is collected by the indexer for later use
     in a search process. The search is performed via Web interface. C, CGI,
     PHP and Perl search front ends are included.
