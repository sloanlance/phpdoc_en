   These functions allow you to access mnoGoSearch (former
   UdmSearch) free search engine.  In order to have these
   functions available, you must compile php with mnogosearch
   support by using the
   <link linkend="install.configure.with-mnogosearch"><option role="configure">
   --with-mnogosearch</option></link>
   option. If you use this option without specifying the
   path to mnogosearch, php will look for mnogosearch under
   /usr/local/mnogosearch path by default. If you installed
   mnogosearch at other path you should specify it:
   <link linkend="install.configure.with-mnogosearch"><option role="configure">
   --with-mnogosearch=DIR</option></link>.

   mnoGoSearch is a full-featured search engine software for intranet and internet servers,
   distributed under the GNU license. mnoGoSearch has number of unique features, which makes
   it appropriate for a wide range of application from search within your site to a specialized
   search system such as cooking recipes or newspaper search, ftp archive search, news articles search,
   etc. It offers full-text indexing and searching for HTML, PDF, and text documents. mnoGoSearch
   consists of two parts. The first is an indexing mechanism (indexer). The purpose of indexer is
   to walk through HTTP, FTP, NEWS servers or local files, recursively grabbing all the documents
   and storing meta-data about that documents in a SQL database in a smart and effective manner.
   After every document is referenced by its corresponding URL, meta-data collected by indexer is
   used later in a search process. The search is performed via Web interface. C CGI, PHP and Perl
   search front ends are included.

   <para>
    php contains built-in mysql access library, which can be used to
    access mysql. It is known that mnoGoSearch is not compatible with
    this built-in library and can work only with generic mysql
    libraries. Thus, if you use mnoGoSearch with mysql, during php
    configuration you have to indicate directory of mysql
    installation, that was used during mnoGoSearch configuration, i.e. for example:
    <link linkend="install.configure.with-mnogosearch"><option role="configure">
    --with-mnogosearch --with-mysql=/usr</option></link>.
   </para>
  </note>
  <simpara>
   You need at least 3.1.10 version of mnoGoSearch installed to use
   these functions.
