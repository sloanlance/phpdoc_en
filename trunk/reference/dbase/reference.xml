    These functions allow you to access records stored in dBase-format
    (dbf) databases.  In order to use these functions, you must compile
    PHP with the <option role="configure">--enable-dbase</option> option.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    There is no support for indexes or memo fields. There is no
    support for locking, too. Two concurrent webserver processes
    modifying the same dBase file will very likely ruin your database.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    dBase files are simple sequential files of fixed
    length records. Records are appended to the end of
    the file and delete records are kept until you call
    <function>dbase_pack</function>.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    We recommend that you do not use dBase files as your production
    database. Choose any real SQL server instead; MySQL or Postgres
    are common choices with PHP. dBase support is here to allow you to
    import and export data to and from your web database, because the
    file format is commonly understood by Windows spreadsheets and
    organizers.
