 <title>Concepts</title>
 <para>
  The concepts section explains the overall architecture and important concepts
  of the plugin. The materials aim to help you understanding the impact of
  MySQL replication and using the plugin for your development tasks.
  Any application using MySQL replication must take care of certain tasks that
  arise from using a database cluster.
 </para>
 <para>
  It is strongly recommended to work through the materials in order to
  be able to use the plugin with success. This is particulary true, if you are
  new to using MySQL replication.
 </para>
 <section xml:id="mysqlnd-ms.architecture">
  <title>Architecture</title>
  <para>
   The mysqlnd replication and load balancing plugin is
   implemented as a PHP extension.
   It is written in C and operates under the hood of PHP. During the
   startup of the PHP interpreter, in the module init phase of the
   PHP engine, it gets registered as a
   <link linkend="book.mysqlnd">mysqlnd</link> plugin to replace selected
   mysqlnd C methods.
  </para>
  <para>
   At PHP run time it inspects queries send from
   mysqlnd (PHP) to the MySQL server. If a query is recognized as read-only
   it will be sent to one of the configured slave servers. Statements are
   considered read-only if they either start with <literal>SELECT</literal>,
   the SQL hint <literal>/*ms=slave*/</literal> or a slave had been choose for
   running the previous query and the query starts with the SQL hint
   <literal>/*ms=last_used*/</literal>. In all other cases the query will
   be sent to the MySQL replication master server. Applications are requested
   to use the <constant>MYSQLND_MS_MASTER_SWITCH</constant>,
    <constant>MYSQLND_MS_SLAVE_SWITCH</constant> and
    <constant>MYSQLND_MS_LAST_USED_SWITCH</constant>
    <link linkend="mysqlnd-ms.constants">predefined constants</link>
    instead of their literal  values,
    such as <literal>/*ms=slave*/</literal>,
    for better portability.
  </para>
  <para>
   The plugin takes care internally of opening and closing the database connections
   to the master server and the slave servers. From an application
   point of view there continues to be only one connection handle. However,
   internally, this one public connection handle represents a pool of
   network connections managed by the plugin. The plugin proxies queries
   to the master server and the slave ones using multiple connections.
  </para>
  <para>
    Database connections have a state consisting of, for example, transaction
    status, transaction settings, character set settings, temporary tables.
    The plugin will try to maintain the same state among all internal
    connections, whenever this can be done in an automatic and transparent way.
    In cases where it is not easily possible to maintain state among all
    connections, such as when using <literal>BEGIN TRANSACTION</literal>, the
    plugin leaves it to the user to handle. Please, find further details below.
  </para>

 <section xml:id="mysqlnd-ms.pooling">
  <title>Connection pooling and switching</title>
  <para>
   The replication and load balancing plugin changes the semantics of a PHP
   MySQL connection handle. The existing API of the PHP MySQL extensions
   (<link linkend="ref.mysqli">mysqli</link>,
  <link linkend="ref.mysql">mysql</link>,
  <link linkend="ref.pdo-mysql">PDO_MYSQL</link>) are not changed in
  a way that functions are added or removed. But their behaviour
  changes when using the plugin. Existing applications do not need to
  be adapted to a new API. But they may need to be modified because of
  the behaviour changes.
  </para>
  <para>
   The plugin breaks the one-by-one relationship between a
   <link linkend="ref.mysqli">mysqli</link>,
   <link linkend="ref.mysql">mysql</link>,
   <link linkend="ref.pdo-mysql">PDO_MYSQL</link> connection
   handle and a MySQL network connection. If using the plugin a
   <link linkend="ref.mysqli">mysqli</link>,
   <link linkend="ref.mysql">mysql</link>,
   <link linkend="ref.pdo-mysql">PDO_MYSQL</link> connection
   handle represents a local pool of connections to the configured
   MySQL replication master and the MySQL replication slave servers.
   The plugin redirects queries to the master and slave servers.
   At some point in time one and the same PHP connection handle
   may point to the MySQL master server. Later on, it may point
   to one of the slave servers or still the master. Manipulating
   and replacing the network connection referenced by a PHP MySQL
   connection handle is not a transparent operation.
  </para>
  <para>
   Every MySQL connection has a state. The state of the connections in
   the connection pool of the plugin can differ. Whenever the
   plugin switches from one wire connection to another, the current state of
   the user connection may change. The applications must be aware of this.

   The following list shows what the connection state consists of. The list

   The plugins philosophy is to align the state of connections in the

   necessary for security reasons. Just a few actions that change the
   state of the connection fall into this category.

    If any of the above listed calls is to be executed,
    the plugin loops over all currently open master and slave connections.
    The loop continues until all servers have been contacted. The loop does
    not break, if a server indicates a failure. If possible, the failure will be
    propagated to the calling user API function. Depending on the user API
    function, which has triggered the underlying library function, users may
    be able to detect the failure.

   Please note that the connection state is not only changed by API calls. Thus,
   even if PECL mysqlnd_ms monitors all API calls, the application still needs
   to take care. Ultimately, it is in the applications reposibility
   to maintain connection state, if needed.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="mysqlnd-ms.transaction">
  <title>Transaction handling</title>
  <para>
   Transaction handling is fundamentally changed.
   A SQL transaction is a unit of work run on one database server. The
   unit of work consists of one or more SQL statements.
  </para>
  <para>
    By default the plugin is not aware of SQL transactions. The plugin may
    switch connections for load balancing at any point in time. Connection
    switches may happen in the middle of a transaction. This is against the
    nature of a SQL transaction. By default the plugin is not transaction safe.
  </para>
  <para>
    At the time of writing, applications using SQL transactions together with
    the plugin must use SQL hints to disable connection switches in the middle
    of a SQL transaction. Please, find details in the examples section.
  </para>
  <para>
    The latest version of the <literal>mysqlnd</literal> library, as found in
    PHP 5.4.0, allows the plugin to subclass the library C API call
    <literal>set_autocommit()</literal> to
    detect the status of the <literal>autocommit</literal> mode. The PHP MySQL
    extensions either issue a query such as <literal>SET AUTOCOMMIT=0|1</literal>
    or use the mysqlnd library call <literal>set_autcommit()</literal> to control
    the <literal>autocommit</literal> setting. If an extension makes use of
    <literal>set_autocommit()</literal>, the plugin can be made transaction aware.
    Transaction awareness cannot be achieved, if using SQL to set the autocommit
    mode.
    The library function <literal>set_autocommit()</literal> is called by the
    <function>mysqli_autocommit</function> and
    <literal>PDO::setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT)</literal> user API calls.
  </para>
  <para>
    The experimental pluging configuration option
    <literal>trx_stickiness=master</literal> can be used to make the plugin
    transaction aware if using PHP 5.4.0 or newer. In this mode the plugin stops load
    balancing if autocommit gets disabled and directs all statements to the
    master until autocommit gets enabled.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="mysqlnd-ms.errorhandling">
  <title>Error handling</title>
  <para>
   Applications using PECL/mysqlnd_ms should to proper error handling
   of any user API call. Due to the fact that the plugin changes the semantics
   of a connection handle, API calls may return unexpected errors. If using
   the plugin a connection handle no longer represents an individual network
   connection but a connection pool. An error code and error message will
   be set on the connection handle whenever an error occurs on any of the network
   connections behind.
  </para>
  <para>
   If using lazy connections, which is a default, connections are not
   opened until needed for query execution. Therefore, it can happen that
   an API call for statement execution returns a connection error.
   In the example an error is provoked when trying to run a statement on a slave.
   Opening a slave connection fails because the plugins configuration file
   lists an invalid host name of the slave.

   Applications are expected to be able to handle the connection error. In
   most cases this will not require code changes, if the application does
   proper error handling already.
  </para>
  <para>
   Depending on the use case applications may want to handle connection errors
   differently from other errors.  Typical connection errors are
   <literal>2002 (CR_CONNECTION_ERROR) - Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '%s' (%d)</literal>,
   <literal>2003 (CR_CONN_HOST_ERROR) - Can't connect to MySQL server on '%s' (%d)</literal> and
   <literal>2005 (CR_UNKNOWN_HOST) - Unknown MySQL server host '%s' (%d)</literal>.
   For example, the application may test for the error codes and manually
   perform fail over. The plugins philosophy is not to offer automatic fail over
   beyond master fail over because fail over is not a transparent operation.

   In some cases, it may not be easily possible to retrieve all errors that
   occur on all network connections through a connection handle. Assume a
   connection handle represents a pool of three open connections. One connection
   to a master and two connections to the slaves. The application changes the
   current database using the user API call <function>mysqli_select_db</function>,
   which in turn calls the mysqlnd library function to change the schemata.
   PECL/mysqlnd_ms monitors the function and tries to change the current
   database on all connections.to harmonize their state. Let the master succeed
   in changing the database and let both slaves fail. Upon the first error
   from the first slave, the plugin will set an appropriate error on the
   connection handle. The same is done when the second slave fails to change the
   database. The error message from the first slave is lost.

   Such cases can be debugged by either checking for errors of the type

   to possible errors. If, for example, the plugin recognizes a query as a read-only
   query to be sent to the slave servers and the slave server selected by the
   plugin is not available, the plugin will raise an error after not executing
   the statement.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is up to
   the application to handle the error and, if need be, re-issue the query to
   trigger selection of another slave server for statement execution.
   The plugin will make no attempts to failover automatically because the plugin
   cannot ensure that an automatic failover will not change the state of
   the connection. For example, the application may have issued a query
   which depends on SQL user variables which are bound to a specific connection.
   Such a query might return wrong results if the plugin would switch the
   connection implicitly as part of automatic failover. To ensure correct
   results the application must take care of the failover and rebuild
   the required connection state. Therefore, by default, no automatic failover
   is done by the plugin.
  </para>
  <para>
    An user who does not change the connection state after opening a connection
    may activate automatic master failover.
  </para>
  <para>
    The failover policy is configured in the plugins configuration file by help
    of the
    <literal><link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.failover">failover</link></literal>
    configuration directive.

 <section xml:id="mysqlnd-ms.loadbalancing">
  <title>Load balancing</title>
  <para>
    Four load balancing strategies are supported to distribute read-only
    statements over the configured MySQL slave servers: random, random once,
    round robin and user defined via callback. Random picks a random
    server whenever a statement is to be executed. Random once picks a
    random server once when the first statement is executed and uses
    the decision for the rest of the PHP request. Random once is the default,
    if nothing else is configured because random once has the lowest impact
    on the connection state. Round robin iterates over the list of
    configured servers. A user defined callback can be used to implement
    any other strategy.
  </para>
  <para>
    The load balancing policy is configured in the plugins configuration
    file using the
    <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.filter_random">random</link>,
    <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.filter_roundrobin">roundrobin</link>
    and <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.filter_user">user</link>
    filter. Please, see below to learn more about
    <link linkend="mysqlnd-ms.filter">filter</link>.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="mysqlnd-ms.rwsplit">
  <title>Read-write splitting</title>
  <para>
   The plugin runs read-only statements on the configured MySQL slaves and
   all other queries on the MySQL master. Statements are
   considered read-only if they either start with <literal>SELECT</literal>,
   the SQL hint <literal>/*ms=slave*/</literal> or a slave had been chosen for
   running the previous query and the query starts with the SQL hint
   <literal>/*ms=last_used*/</literal>. In all other cases the query will
   be send to the MySQL replication master server. It is recommended to
   use the constants <literal>MYSQLND_MS_SLAVE_SWITCH</literal>,
   <literal>MYSQLND_MS_MASTER_SWITCH</literal> and <literal>MYSQLND_MS_LAST_USED_SWITCH</literal>
   instead of <literal>/*ms=slave*/</literal>. Please see,
   <link linkend="mysqlnd-ms.constants">constants</link>.
  </para>
  <para>
   SQL hints are a special kind of standard compliant SQL comments. The plugin
   does check every statement for certain SQL hints. The SQL hints are described
   together with the <link linkend="mysqlnd-ms.constants">constants</link>
   exported by the extension. Other systems
   involved in the statement processing, such as the MySQL server, SQL firewalls
   or SQL proxies are unaffected by the SQL hints because those systems are
   supposed to ignore SQL comments.
  </para>
  <para>
   The built-in read-write splitter can be replaced by a user-defined one, see also
   <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.filter_user"><literal>user</literal></link>
   filter.
  </para>
  <para>
    A user-defined read-write splitter can ask the built-in logic to make
    a proposal where to sent a statement by invoking
    <link linkend="function.mysqlnd-ms-query-is-select"><function>mysqlnd_ms_is_select</function></link>.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    The built-in read-write splitter is not aware of multi-statements.
    Multi-statements are seen as one statement. The splitter will check the
    beginning of the statement to decide where to run the statement. If, for example,
    a multi-statement begins with
    <literal>SELECT 1 FROM DUAL; INSERT INTO test(id) VALUES (1); ...</literal>
    the plugin will run it on a slave although the statement is not read-only.

 <section xml:id="mysqlnd-ms.filter">
  <title>Filter</title>
  <note>
    <para>
     The below description applies to PECL/mysqlnd_ms &gt;= 1.1.0-beta.
     It is not valid for earlier versions.
    </para>
   </note>
  <para>
   PECL/mysqlnd 1.1.0-beta introduces the concept of
   <link linkend="mysqlnd-ms.plugin-ini-json">filters</link>.
   Any PHP application using any kind of MySQL replication cluster first needs to identify
   a group of servers in the cluster which could execute a given statement before
   the statement is executed on one of the candidates. In other words: a given
   list of servers has to be filtered until one server is left.
  </para>
  <para>
   The process of filtering may include the use one or more filters. Filters can be
   chained. They are executed in the order of their appearance in the plugins
   configuration file. The concept of chained filters can be compared to using
   pipes to connect command line utitilies on an operating system command shell: an input stream
   is passed to a processor, filtered and transferred to be output.
   Then the output is passed as input to the next command which is connected
   to the previous using the pipe operator.
  </para>
  <para>
   The following filters are available with version 1.1.0-beta.
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Load balancing filter:
      <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.filters"><literal>random</literal></link>,
      <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.filters"><literal>roundrobin</literal></link>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Selection filter:
      <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.filters"><literal>user</literal></link>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   The <literal>random</literal> and <literal>roundrobin</literal>
   filters replace the
   <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config.pick"><literal>pick[]</literal></link>
   configuration directive found in earlier versions. The <literal>random</literal>
   filter implementes the random and random once load balancing policies.
   Round robin load balancing can be configured through the
   <literal>roundrobin</literal> filter. Setting a user defined callbacks for server
   selection is possible with the <literal>user</literal> filter. The
   <link linkend="function.mysqlnd-ms-set-user-pick-server">
   <function>mysqlnd_ms_set_user_pick_server</function></link> function previously
   used for this has been removed.
  </para>
  <para>
   Filters can accept parameters to change their behaviour.
   The <literal>random</literal> filter accepts an optional
   <literal>sticky</literal> parameter. If set to true, the filter chnages
  load balancing from random to random once. Random picks a random server
   every time a statement is to be executed. Random once picks a random
   server when the first statement is to be executed and uses the same
   server for the rest of the PHP request.
  </para>
  <para>
   One of the biggest strength of the filter concept is the possibility to
   chain filters. This strength coes not become immediately visible with the
   filters provided by version 1.1.0-beta because all of the above filters
   are supposed to output no more than one server. If a filter reduces
   the list of candidates for running a statement to only one server, it
   makes little sense to use that one server as input for another filter for
   further reduction of the list of candidates.
  </para>
  <para>
   A filter sequence of not much value:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Statement to be excuted: <literal>SELECT 1 FROM DUAL</literal>. Passed to all filters.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      All configured nodes are passed as input to the first filter.
      Master nodes: <literal>master_0</literal>.
      Slave nodes:<literal>slave_0</literal>, <literal>slave_1</literal>
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Filter: <literal>random</literal>, argument <literal>sticky=1</literal>.
      Picks a random slave once to be used for the rest of the PHP request.
      Output: <literal>slave_0</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Output of <literal>slave_0</literal> and the statement to be executed
      is passed as input to the next filter. Here: <literal>roundrobin</literal>,
      server list passed to filter is: <literal>slave_0</literal>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Filter: <literal>roundrobin</literal>. Server list consists of
      one server only, round robin will always return the same server.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   If trying to use such a filter sequence,
   the plugin may emit a warning like <literal>(mysqlnd_ms) Error while creating
   filter '%s' . Non-multi filter '%s' already created. Stopping in %s on
   line %d</literal>. Furthermode an appropriate error on the connection handle
   may be set.
  </para>
  <para>
   In future versions there may be filters which return more than one candidate
   for statement execution. For example, there may be a <literal>table</literal>
   filter to support MySQL replication filtering. MySQL replication filter allow
   you to define rules which database or table is to be replicated to which
   node of a replication cluster. Assume your replication cluster
   consists of four slaves (<literal>slave_0</literal>, <literal>slave_1</literal>,
   <literal>slave_2</literal>, <literal>slave_3</literal>) two of which replicate a database named
   <literal>sales</literal> (<literal>slave_0</literal>, <literal>slave_1</literal>).
   If the application queries the database.<literal>slaves</literal> the
   hypothetical <literal>table</literal> filter reduces the list of possible
   servers to <literal>slave_0</literal>, <literal>slave_1</literal>. Because
   the output and list of candidates consists of more than one server, it is
   necessary and possible to further filter the candidate list, for example, using
   a load balancing filter to identiy a server for statement execution.
  </para>
  <para>

    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Output of <literal>slave_0</literal>, <literal>slave_1</literal>
      and the statement to be executed

    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Filter: <literal>roundrobin</literal>. Server list consists of
      two servers. Round robin selectes <literal>slave_0</literal>.
      Upon subsequent execution, if the same server list is given as
      input, the filter will return <literal>slave_1</literal> followed
      by <literal>slave_0</literal>, <literal>slave_1</literal>,
      <literal>slave_0</literal> and so forth.
