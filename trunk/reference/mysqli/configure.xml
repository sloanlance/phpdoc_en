 <para xml:id="mysqli.configure">
  To install the <literal>mysqli</literal> extension for PHP, use the
  <option role="configure">--with-mysqli=mysql_config_path/mysql_config</option>
  configuration option where <literal>mysql_config_path</literal>
  represents the location of the <literal>mysql_config</literal> program
  that comes with MySQL versions greater than 4.1.
 </para>

 <para>
  With versions of PHP 5.3 and newer, you can alternatively use
  <option role="configure">--with-mysqli=mysqlnd</option>. This is the
  recommended option as using the MySQL Native Driver results in
  improved performance and gives access to features not available when
  using the MySQL Client Library. Refer to
  <link linkend="mysqli.overview.mysqlnd">What is PHP's MySQL Native
  Driver?</link> for a brief overview of the advantages of MySQL Native
  Driver.
 </para>

 <para>
  If you would like to install the mysql extension along with the mysqli
  extension you have to use the same client library to avoid any
  conflicts.

 <section xml:id="mysqli.installation.windows">

  <title>Installation on Windows Systems</title>

  <para>
   The <literal>mysqli</literal> extension is not enabled by default, so
   the <filename>php_mysqli.dll</filename> DLL must be enabled inside of
   &php.ini;. Also, PHP needs access to the MySQL client library. A file
   named <filename>libmysql.dll</filename> is included in the Windows
   PHP distribution and in order for PHP to talk to MySQL this file
   needs to be available to the Windows systems <envar>PATH</envar>. See
   the FAQ titled "<link linkend="faq.installation.addtopath">How do I
   add my PHP directory to the PATH on Windows</link>" for information
   on how to do this. Although copying <filename>libmysql.dll</filename>
   to the Windows system directory also works (because the system
   directory is by default in the system's <envar>PATH</envar>), it's
   not recommended.
  </para>

  <para>
   On Windows, for PHP versions 5.3 and newer, the
   <literal>mysqli</literal> extension uses the MySQL Native Driver by
   default. This means you don't need to worry about configuring access
   to <filename>libmysql.dll</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   As with enabling any PHP extension (such as
   <filename>php_mysqli.dll</filename>), the PHP directive
   <link linkend="ini.extension-dir">extension_dir</link> should be set
   to the directory where the PHP extensions are located. See also the
   <link linkend="install.windows.manual">Manual Windows Installation
   Instructions</link>. An example extension_dir value for PHP 5 is
   <literal>c:\php\ext</literal>
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    If when starting the web server an error similar to the following
    occurs: <literal>"Unable to load dynamic library
    './php_mysqli.dll'"</literal>, this is because
    <filename>php_mysqli.dll</filename> and/or
    <filename>libmysql.dll</filename> cannot be found by the system.
   </para>
