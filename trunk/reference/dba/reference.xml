    These functions build the foundation for accessing Berkeley DB
    style databases.

    This is a general abstraction layer for several file-based databases.
    As such, functionality is limited to a common subset of features
    supported by modern databases such as
    <ulink url="&url.sleepycat;">Sleepycat Software's DB2</ulink>.
    (This is not to be confused with IBM's DB2 software, which is
    supported through the <link linkend="ref.odbc">ODBC functions</link>.)

     The behaviour of various aspects depends on the implementation of the
     underlying database. Functions such as <function>dba_optimize</function>
     and <function>dba_sync</function> will do what they promise for one
     database and will do nothing for others. You have to download and install
     supported dba-Handlers.

         Dbm is the oldest (original) type of Berkeley DB style
         databases. You should avoid it, if possible. We do not support
         the compatibility functions built into DB2 and gdbm, because
         they are only compatible on the source code level, but cannot
         handle the original dbm format.

         Ndbm is a newer type and more flexible than dbm. It still has
         most of the arbitrary limits of dbm (therefore it is

         Cdb is "a fast, reliable, lightweight package for creating and
         reading constant databases." It is from the author of qmail and
         can be found <ulink url="&url.cdb;">here</ulink>. Since it is
         constant, we support only reading operations. And since PHP 4.3.0
         we support writing (not updating) through the internal cdb library.

         This is available since PHP 4.3.0 for compatibility with the deprecated

         However you may use this where files were created in this format. That
         happens when configure could not find any external library.

     DBA is binary safe and does not have any arbitrary limits.
     However, it inherits all limits set by the underlying
     database implementation.
    </para>
    <para>
     All file-based databases must provide a way of setting the file
     mode of a new created database, if that is possible at all. The
     file mode is commonly passed as the fourth argument to
     <function>dba_open</function> or <function>dba_popen</function>.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can access all entries of a database in a linear way by using the
     <function>dba_firstkey</function> and <function>dba_nextkey</function>
     functions. You may not change the database while traversing it.
