  Although the default APC settings are fine for many installations, serious
  users should consider tuning the following parameters.

      <literal>apc.enabled</literal> can be set to 0 to disable APC. This is
      primarily useful when APC is statically compiled
      into PHP, since there is no other way to disable
      it (when compiled as a DSO, the <literal>extension</literal>
      line in <literal>php.ini</literal> can just be commented-out).

      A "hint" about the number of distinct source files
      that will be included or requested on your web
      server. Set to zero or omit if you're not sure;
      this setting is mainly useful for sites that have

      The number of seconds a cache entry is allowed to
      idle in a slot in case this cache entry slot is
      needed by another entry.  Leaving this at zero
      means that your cache could potentially fill up

     <para>
      The number of seconds that a cache entry may
      remain on the garbage-collection list. This value
      provides a failsafe in the event that a server
      process dies while executing a cached source file;
      if that source file is modified, the memory
      allocated for the old version will not be
      reclaimed until this TTL reached. Set to zero to
      disable this feature.

      On by default, but can be set to off and used in
      conjunction with positive <literal>apc.filters</literal> so that files
      are only cached if matched by a positive filter.

     <para>
      A comma-separated list of POSIX extended regular
      expressions. If any pattern matches the source
      filename, the file will not be cached. Note that
      the filename used for matching is the one passed
      to include/require, not the absolute path.  If the
      first character of the expression is a <literal>+</literal> then the
      expression will be additive in the sense that any
      files matched by the expression will be cached, and
      if the first character is a <literal>-</literal> then anything matched
      will not be cached.  The <literal>-</literal> case is the default, so
      it can be left off.

      If compiled with MMAP support by using <literal>--enable-mmap</literal>
      this is the mktemp-style file_mask to pass to the
      mmap module for determing whether your mmap'ed memory
      region is going to be file-backed or shared memory
      backed.  For straight file-backed mmap, set it to
      something like <literal>/tmp/apc.XXXXXX</literal>
      (exactly 6 <literal>X</literal>s).
      To use POSIX-style shm_open/mmap put a <literal>.shm</literal>
      somewhere in your mask.  e.g. <literal>/apc.shm.XXXXXX</literal>
      You can also set it to <literal>/dev/zero</literal> to use your
      kernel's <literal>/dev/zero</literal> interface to anonymous mmap'ed
      memory.  Leaving it undefined will force an anonymous mmap.

      On very busy servers whenever you start the server or
      modify files you can create a race of many processes
      all trying to cache the same file at the same time.
      This option sets the percentage of processes that will
      skip trying to cache an uncached file.  Or think of it
      as the probability of a single process to skip caching.
      For example, setting <literal>apc.slam_defense</literal>
      to <literal>75</literal> would mean that there is
      a 75% chance that the process will not cache an uncached
      file. So, the higher the setting the greater the defense
      against cache slams.  Setting this to <literal>0</literal>
      disables this feature.

      When you modify a file on a live web server you really
      should do so in an atomic manner.  That is, write to a
      temporary file and rename (<literal>mv</literal>) the file into its
      permanent position when it is ready.  Many text editors, cp, tar and
      other such programs don't do this.  This means that there
      is a chance that a file is accessed (and cached) while it
      is still being written to.  This <literal>apc.file_update_protection</literal>
      setting puts a delay on caching brand new files.  The
      default is 2 seconds which means that if the modification
      timestamp (<literal>mtime</literal>) on a file shows that it is less than 2
      seconds old when it is accessed, it will not be cached.
      The unfortunate person who accessed this half-written file
      will still see weirdness, but at least it won't persist.
      If you are certain you always atomically update your files
      by using something like rsync which does this correctly, you
      can turn this protection off by setting it to 0.  If you
      have a system that is flooded with io causing some update
      procedure to take longer than 2 seconds, you may want to
      increase this a bit.

      Mostly for testing and debugging.  Setting this enables APC
      for the CLI version of PHP.  Normally you wouldn't want to
      create, populate and tear down the APC cache on every CLI
      request, but for various test scenarios it is handy to be
      able to enable APC for the CLI version of APC easily.
