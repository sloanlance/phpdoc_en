    PHP supports libcurl, a library created by Daniel Stenberg, that
    allows you to connect and communicate to many different types of
    servers with many different types of protocols.  libcurl currently
    supports the http, https, ftp, gopher, telnet, dict, file, and
    ldap protocols.  libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP
    POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading (this can also be done with PHP's
    ftp extension), HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, and
    user+password authentication.

    In order to use the CURL functions you need to install the <ulink
    url="&url.curl;">CURL</ulink> package. PHP requires that you use
    CURL 7.0.2-beta or higher. PHP will not work with any version of
    CURL below version 7.0.2-beta.
   </para>
   <para>
    To use PHP's CURL support you must also compile PHP <option
    role="configure">--with-curl[=DIR]</option> where DIR is the
    location of the directory containing the lib and include
    directories.  In the "include" directory there should be a folder
    named "curl" which should contain the easy.h and curl.h files.
    There should be a file named "libcurl.a" located in the "lib"
    directory.
   </para>
   <para>
    These functions have been added in PHP 4.0.2.

    Once you've compiled PHP with CURL support, you can begin using
    the curl functions.  The basic idea behind the CURL functions is
    that you initialize a CURL session using the
    <function>curl_init</function>, then you can set all your
    options for the transfer via the <function>curl_exec</function>
    and then you finish off your session using the
    <function>curl_close</function>.  Here is an example that uses
    the CURL functions to fetch the PHP homepage into a file:
    <example>
     <title>Using PHP's CURL module to fetch the PHP homepage</title>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

$ch = curl_init ("http://www.example.com/");
$fp = fopen ("example_homepage.txt", "w");

curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_FILE, $fp);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);

curl_exec ($ch);
curl_close ($ch);
fclose ($fp);
?>

     </programlisting>
