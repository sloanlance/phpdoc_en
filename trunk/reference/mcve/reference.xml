     These functions interface the MCVE API (libmcve), allowing you
     to work directly with MCVE from your PHP scripts.  MCVE is
     Main Street Softworks' solution to direct credit card processing.
     It lets you directly address the credit card clearing houses via
     your *nix box, modem and/or internet connection (bypassing the
     need for an additional service such as Authorize.Net or Pay
     Flow Pro).  Using the MCVE module for PHP, you can process
     credit cards directly through MCVE via your PHP scripts. The
     following references will outline the process.

      MCVE is the replacement for RedHat's CCVS. They contracted with
      RedHat in late 2001 to migrate all existing clientelle to the
      MCVE platform.

     To enable MCVE Support in PHP, first verify your LibMCVE installation
     directory.  You will then need to configure PHP with the <option
     role="configure">--with-mcve</option> option.  If you use this
     option without specifying the path to your MCVE installation, PHP
     will attempt to look in the default LibMCVE Install location
     (/usr/local).  If MCVE is in a non-standard location, run
     configure with: <option
     role="configure">--with-mcve=$mcve_path</option>, where $mcve_path
     is the path to your MCVE installation.  Please note that MCVE 
     support requires that $mcve_path/lib and $mcve_path/include exist,
     and include mcve.h under the include directory and libmcve.so and/or
     libmcve.a under the lib directory.
    </para>
    <para>
     Since MCVE has true server/client separation, there are no additional
     requirements for running PHP with MCVE support.  To test your 
     MCVE extension in PHP, you may connect to testbox.mcve.com on 
     port 8333 for IP, or port 8444 for SSL using the MCVE PHP API.
     Use 'vitale' for your username, and 'test' for your password.
     Additional information about test facilities are available at
     <ulink url="http://www.mcve.com">www.mcve.com</ulink>.
