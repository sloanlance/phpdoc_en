     First of all: Ming is not an acronym. Ming is an open-source (LGPL)
     library which allows you to create SWF ("Flash") format movies. Ming
     supports almost all of Flash 4's features, including: shapes, gradients,
     bitmaps (pngs and jpegs), morphs ("shape tweens"), text, buttons,
     actions, sprites ("movie clips"), streaming mp3, and color transforms
     --the only thing that's missing is sound events.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note that all values specifying length, distance, size, etc. are in "twips", 
     twenty units per pixel. That's pretty much arbitrary, though, since the player
     scales the movie to whatever pixel size is specified in the embed/object tag, 
     or the entire frame if not embedded. 
    </para>
    <para>
     Ming offers a number of advantages over the existing
     <link linkend="ref.swf">PHP/libswf module</link>.
     You can use Ming anywhere you can compile the code, whereas libswf is
     closed-source and only available for a few platforms, Windows not one of
     them. Ming provides some insulation from the mundane details of the SWF
     file format, wrapping the movie elements in PHP objects. Also, Ming is
     still being maintained; if there's a feature that you want to see, just
     let us know <ulink url="mailto:&email.ming;">&email.ming;</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Ming was added in PHP 4.0.5.

   <section id="ming.requirements">
    &reftitle.required;
    <para>
     To use Ming with PHP, you first need to build and install the Ming
     library. Source code and installation instructions are available at the
     Ming home page: <ulink url="&url.ming;">&url.ming;</ulink>
     along with examples, a small tutorial, and the latest news.
    </para>
    <para>
     Download the ming archive. Unpack the archive. Go in the
     Ming directory. make. make install.
    </para>
    <para>
     This will build <filename>libming.so</filename> and install it
     into <filename>/usr/lib/</filename>, and copy 
     <filename>ming.h</filename> into <filename>/usr/include/</filename>.
     Edit the <literal>PREFIX=</literal> line in the
     <filename>Makefile</filename> to change the installation directory.
    </para>
   </section>

   <section id="ming.install">
    &reftitle.install;
     <para>
      <example>
      <title>built into php (unix)</title>
      <literallayout>
<![CDATA[
       mkdir <phpdir>/ext/ming
       cp php_ext/* <phpdir>/ext/ming
       cd <phpdir>
       ./buildconf 
       ./configure --with-ming <other config options>
]]>
       </literallayout>
      </example>
      Build and install php as usual,
      restart web server if necessary.
     </para>
     <para>
      Now either just add <literal>extension=php_ming.so</literal> 
      to your &php.ini; file, or put
      <literal>dl('php_ming.so');</literal> at the head of all of your
      Ming scripts.
