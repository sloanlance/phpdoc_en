 <title>Updates</title>

 <para>
  Updates can be one of the the most complicated operation available with 
  MongoDB.  They combine a query with an action, modifying documents that match
  the criteria.  They are also extremely powerful, allowing you to change 
  documents quickly and replace them altogether.  They are done in-place (when 
  possible) with little overhead.

  <title>Updating Nested Objects</title>

  <para>
   Suppose we wish to change the name of a comment's author in this document:

   <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
{ 
    "_id" : ObjectId("4b06c282edb87a281e09dad9"), 
    "content" : "this is a blog post.",
    "comments" : 
    [
        {
            "author" : "Mike",
            "comment" : "I think that blah blah blah...",
        },
        {
            "author" : "John",
            "comment" : "I disagree."
        }
    ]
}
]]>
   </programlisting>

   In order to change an inner field, we use $set (so that all of the other 
   fields are not removed!) with the index of comment to change:

   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

$blog->update($criteria, array('$set' => array("comments.1" => array("author" => "Jim"))));

?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </para>
 </section>
</chapter>
