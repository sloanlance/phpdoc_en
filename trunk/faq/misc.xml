    <question>
     <para>
      Where did the pop-ups go on the website? 
      Can I have the code for that?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      The yellow pop-up windows on the old site were pretty cool, but
      were very difficult to maintain (since some companies seem to
      enjoy changing the way their browsers work with every new release).
    </para>
    <para>
      All the code for previous versions of the website is still available
      through CVS.  Specifically, the last version of shared.inc (that had
      all the Javascript and DHTML to do the popups) is available 
      <ulink url="&faqurl.popup;">here</ulink>.

   <qandaentry id="faq.misc.bz2">
    <question>
     <para>
      How can I handle the bz2 compressed manuals on Windows?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      If you don't have an archiver-tool to handle bz2 files
      <ulink url="&faqurl.bz2;">download</ulink> the commandline tool
      from Redhat. Win2k Sp2 users grab the latest version 1.0.2, all
      other Windows user should grab version 1.00. After downloading rename
      the executable to bzip2.exe. For convenience put it into a directory in
      your path, e.g. C:\Windows where C represents your windows installation
      drive.
     </para>
     <para>
      Note: lang stands for your language and x for the desired format, e.g.: pdf.
      To uncompress the php_manual_lang.x.bz2 follow these simple instructions:
      1. open a command prompt window.
      2. cd to the folder where you stored the downloaded php_manual_lang.x.bz2.
      3. Invoking bzip2 -d php_manual_lang.x.bz2 will extract php_manual_lang.x
      in the same folder. Thats it.
     </para>
     <para>
      In case you downloaded the php_manual_lang.tar.bz2 many html-files
      the procedure is the same. The only difference is that you got a file
      php_manual_lang.tar. The tar format is known to be treated with most
      common archivers on Windows like e.g. Winzip.
