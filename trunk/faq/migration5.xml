      Migrating from PHP 4 to PHP 5
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Although PHP 5 offers many new features, it's designed to be as
      compatible with earlier versions of PHP as possible with little
      functionality being broken in the process.
     </para>
     <para>
      Be sure to read the appropriate <link linkend="migration5">PHP 5
      migration appendix</link> of this manual as it contains even more
      information on the topic of migrating to PHP 5.

   <qandaentry id="faq.migration5.mysql">
    <question>
     <para>
      Does MySQL work in PHP 5?  It seemed to have disappeared.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      <link linkend="ref.mysql">MySQL</link> is supported with the only
      change being that MySQL support is no longer enabled by 
      <emphasis>default</emphasis> in PHP 5.  This essentially means that
      PHP doesn't include <literal>--with-mysql</literal> in the 
      <link linkend="configuration">configure</link> line so that you must
      now manually do this when compiling PHP.  Windows users will 
      edit &php.ini; and enable the <filename>php_mysql.dll</filename> DLL as
      in PHP 4 no such DLL existed, it was simply built into your Windows
      PHP binaries.
     </para>
     <para>
      Also, the MySQL client libraries are no longer bundled with PHP.  More
      details on this topic are covered in 
      <link linkend="faq.databases.mysql.php5">the following FAQ</link> and
      be sure to read the <link linkend="ref.mysql">MySQL section</link>
      for details on installing MySQL.  An example configure line would be 
      <literal>--with-mysql=/usr</literal> while Windows users will need
      the <filename>libmySQL.dll</filename> available to the system.
     </para>

   <qandaentry id="faq.migration5.oop">
    <question>
     <para>
      I hear PHP 5 has an entirely new OOP model, will my existing OOP code
      work?  Where do I find information on these new OOP features? 
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      The main change in PHP 5 is to the OOP model as PHP 5 now uses
      the <emphasis>Zend Engine 2.0</emphasis>.  The <link 
      linkend="ini.zend.ze1-compatibility-mode">
      zend.ze1_compatibility_mode</link> directive enables compatability
      with the Zend Engine 1.0 (PHP 4).
     </para>
     <para>
      The new OOP model is documented in the <link linkend="language.oop5">
      OOP language reference</link> and <link linkend="migration5.oop">OOP
      migration appendix</link> sections.
     </para>
    </answer>
   </qandaentry>
   
   <qandaentry id="faq.migration5.changes">
    <question>
     <para>
      So besides the new OOP model, what else has changed in PHP 5?  Also, is
      there a PHP 5 specific version of the PHP manual?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Few other changes exist, see the <link linkend="migration5">migration
      5 appendix</link> for details.  There won't be a PHP 5 specific
      version of the manual as the bulk of PHP remains the same.
