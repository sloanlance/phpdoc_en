 <title>A brief note about this How-To</title>
 <para>
  The original version of this PDO driver specification was written by
  Bill Abt and Rick McGuire of IBM and contributed to the PHP community
  to assist in the development of drivers for more databases and to
  encourage the emerging standard for database access in PHP.

 <para>
  Please note that this is still an evolving API and as such, subject to
  change. This document was prepared based on version 0.3 of PDO.
  The learning curve is steep; expect to spend a lot of time on the
  prerequisites.
