    <acronym>PHP</acronym>, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext
    Preprocessor", is an open-source HTML-embedded scripting
    language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and
    Perl with some unique features thrown in. The main goal of
    the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
    generated pages quickly. You can do many more with PHP. Read
    on, and see.
