    <acronym>PHP</acronym>, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext
    Preprocessor" is a widely-used Open Source general-purpose
    scripting language that is especially suited for Web
    development and can be embedded into HTML. Its syntax draws
    upon C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. The main goal of
    the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
    generated webpages quickly, but you can do much more with PHP.

    We highlight the currently most active people on the manual frontpage,
    but there are many more contributors who currently help in our work or
    provided a great amount of help to the project in the past. There are
    a lot of unnamed people who help out with their user notes on manual
    pages, which continually get included in the references, the work of
    whom we are also very thankful. All the lists provided below are in
    alphabetical order.
