     This section contains notes and hints specific to Apache 2.x installs
     of PHP on Unix systems.

     You are highly encouraged to take a look at the
     <link xlink:href="&url.apache2.docs;">Apache Documentation</link> to get
     a basic understanding of the Apache 2.x Server.

     Download the most recent version of <link xlink:href="&url.apache;">
     Apache 2.x</link> and a fitting PHP version from the above mentioned places.
     This quick guide covers only the basics to get started with Apache 2.x
     and PHP. For more information read the
     <link xlink:href="&url.apache2.docs;">Apache Documentation</link>.
     The version numbers have been omitted here, to ensure the
     instructions are not incorrect. You will need to replace the
     'NN' here with the correct values from your files.

    <para>
     There are currently two versions of Apache 2.x - there's 2.0 and 2.2.
     While there are various reasons for choosing each, 2.2 is the current
     latest version, and the one that is recommended, if that option is
     available to you. However, the instructions here will work for either
     2.0 or 2.2.

      Installation Instructions (Apache 2 Shared Module Version)

<![CDATA[
1.  gzip -d httpd-2_x_NN.tar.gz
2.  tar xvf httpd-2_x_NN.tar
3.  gunzip php-NN.tar.gz
4.  tar -xvf php-NN.tar
5.  cd httpd-2_x_NN
6.  ./configure --enable-so
7.  make
8.  make install

    Now you have Apache 2.x.NN available under /usr/local/apache2,
    configured with loadable module support and the standard MPM prefork.
    To test the installation use your normal procedure for starting
    the Apache server, e.g.:
    /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
    and stop the server to go on with the configuration for PHP:
    /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl stop.

9.  cd ../php-NN

10. Now, configure your PHP.  This is where you customize your PHP
    with various options, like which extensions will be enabled.  Do a
    ./configure --help for a list of available options.  In our example
    we'll do a simple configure with Apache 2 and MySQL support.  Your
    path to apxs may differ, in fact, the binary may even be named apxs2 on
    your system. 
    
      ./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs --with-mysql

11. make
12. make install

    If you decide to change your configure options after installation,
    you only need to repeat the last three steps. You only need to
    restart apache for the new module to take effect. A recompile of
    Apache is not needed.
                
    Note that unless told otherwise, 'make install' will also install PEAR,
    various PHP tools such as phpize, install the PHP CLI, and more.
    
13. Setup your php.ini 
    
    cp php.ini-development /usr/local/lib/php.ini
          
    You may edit your .ini file to set PHP options.  If you prefer having
    php.ini in another location, use --with-config-file-path=/some/path in
    step 10.
    
    If you instead choose php.ini-production, be certain to read the list
    of changes within, as they affect how PHP behaves.

14. Edit your httpd.conf to load the PHP module.  The path on the right hand
    side of the LoadModule statement must point to the path of the PHP
    module on your system.  The make install from above may have already
    added this for you, but be sure to check.

    For PHP 4:
  
      LoadModule php4_module modules/libphp4.so
      
    For PHP 5:
    
      LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so
 
15. Tell Apache to parse certain extensions as PHP.  For example, let's have
    Apache parse .php files as PHP.  Instead of only using the Apache AddType
    directive, we want to avoid potentially dangerous uploads and created
    files such as exploit.php.jpg from being executed as PHP.  Using this
    example, you could have any extension(s) parse as PHP by simply adding
    them.  We'll add .phtml to demonstrate.
            
      <FilesMatch \.php$>
          SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
      </FilesMatch>

    Or, if we wanted to allow .php, .php2, .php3, .php4, .php5, .php6, and
    .phtml files to be executed as PHP, but nothing else, we'd use this:

      <FilesMatch "\.ph(p[2-6]?|tml)$">
          SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
      </FilesMatch>
    
    And to allow .phps files to be handled by the php source filter, and
    displayed as syntax-highlighted source code, use this:

      <FilesMatch "\.phps$">
          SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
      </FilesMatch>

    To allow any arbitrary .php file to be displayed as syntax-highlighted
    source code, without having to rename or copy it to a .phps file, do this:

      RewriteEngine On
      RewriteRule (.*\.php)s$ $1 [H=application/x-httpd-php-source]

16. Use your normal procedure for starting the Apache server, e.g.:
   
      /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

          - OR -

      service httpd restart

     Following the steps above you will have a running Apache2 web server with
     support for PHP as a <literal>SAPI</literal> module.  Of course there are
     many more configuration options available Apache and PHP.  For more
     information type <command>./configure --help</command> in the corresponding
     source tree. If you wish to build a multithreaded version of Apache2, you
     should select the <filename>worker</filename> MPM, rather than the
     standard <filename>prefork</filename> MPM when you build Apache.
     To do this, add the following option to your configure line in step 6
     above:
    </para>
    <example>
    <screen>
     --with-mpm=worker
    </screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     Before doing so,
     please be aware of the consequences and have at least a fair understand of
     the implications. For more information, read the Apache documentation
     regarding <link xlink:href="&url.apache2.mpm;">MPM-Modules</link>.

      To build a multithreaded version of Apache your system must support threads.
      You should also build PHP with experimental
      Zend Thread Safety (ZTS). Under this configuration, not all extensions will be available.
      The recommended setup is to build Apache with the standard
      <filename>prefork</filename> MPM-Module.
