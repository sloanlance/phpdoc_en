What is going on here?

 This folder contains a new organization of the install part, which
 is still forming, and is not yet wired into the manual. It is supposed
 to provide better organization for both the manual writers (via more
 fine grained file placement and granularity) and for readers (via
 instructions organized by operating system instead of server product).
 
 There is still a lot work to do here, before this can replace the install
 part currently used. The manual would probably be invalid and incomplete
 if we would replace the install part right away with this work in progress.
 
So should you translate it?

 Not yet. In fact the install part itself was said to not become target
 for translation for years now, because this reorganization took so much
 time to start. So you'd better focus your efforts on different things
 before this part is ready for production (hopefully in a few weeks time).

How can you help?

 We need people with experience on different systems with different servers,
 so we can update, correct and expand documentation on available systems and
 servers. If you would like to volunteer to rewrite a part or add another
 server or OS into the docs, please contact phpdoc@lists.php.net first before
 messing with the files in CVS.
