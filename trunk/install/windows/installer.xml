    <para>
     The Windows PHP installer is  available from the downloads page at
     <ulink url="&url.php.downloads;">&url.php.downloads;</ulink>. This
     installs the <emphasis>CGI version</emphasis> of <literal>PHP</literal>
     and, for IIS, PWS, and Xitami, configures the web server as well.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      While the InstallShield installer is an easy way to make
      <literal>PHP</literal> work, it is restricted in many aspects, as
      automatic setup of extensions for example is not supported. The whole set
      of supported extensions is only available by downloading the zip binary
      distribution.

     Install your selected <acronym>HTTP</acronym> server on your system and
     make sure that it works.
    </simpara>
    
    <simpara>
     Run the executable installer and follow the instructions provided by the
     installation wizard. Two types of installation are supported - standard,
     which provides sensible defaults for all the settings it can, and advanced,
     which asks questions as it goes along.
    </simpara>
    
    <simpara>
     The installation wizard gathers enough information to set up the &php.ini;
     file and configure the web server to use PHP. For IIS and also PWS on NT
     Workstation, a list of all the nodes on the server with script map settings
     is displayed, and you can choose those nodes to which you wish to add the
     PHP script mappings.
    </simpara>

    <simpara>
     Once the installation has completed the installer will inform you if you
     need to restart your system, restart the server, or just start using PHP.
    </simpara>
    
    <warning>
     <para>
      Be aware, that this setup of PHP is not secure. If you would like to have
      a secure PHP setup, you'd better go on the manual way, and set every
      option carefully. This automatically working setup gives you an instantly
      working PHP installation, but it is not meant to be used on online servers.
