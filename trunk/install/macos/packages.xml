  <title>Using Packages</title>

   There are a few pre-packaged and pre-compiled versions of PHP for
   Mac OS X. This can help in setting up a standard
   configuration, but if you need to have a different set of features
   (such as a secure server, or a different database driver), you may
   need to build PHP and/or your web server yourself. If you are unfamiliar
   with building and compiling your own software, it's worth
   checking whether somebody has already built a packaged
   version of PHP with the features you need.
