 <title>Using PHP from the command line</title>
 <!-- NEW DOCUMENTATION STARTS -->
 <para>
  As of version 4.3.0, <literal>PHP</literal> supports a new
  <literal>SAPI</literal> type (Server Application Programming Interface)
  named <literal>CLI</literal> which means <emphasis>Command Line
  Interface</emphasis>. As the name implies, this <literal>SAPI</literal> type
  main focus is on developing shell (or desktop as well) applications with
  <literal>PHP</literal>.  There are quite a few differences between the
  <literal>CLI SAPI</literal> and other <literal>SAPI</literal>s which are
  explained in this chapter.  It's worth mentioning
  that <literal>CLI</literal> and <literal>CGI</literal> are different
  SAPI's although they do share many of the same behaviors.
 </para>
 <para>
  The <literal>CLI SAPI</literal> was released for the first time with
  <literal>PHP 4.2.0</literal>, but was still experimental and had
  to be explicitly enabled with <literal>--enable-cli</literal> when running
  <literal>./configure</literal>.  Since <literal>PHP 4.3.0</literal> the
  <literal>CLI SAPI</literal> is no longer experimental and the option
  <literal>--enable-cli</literal> is on by default.  You may use
  <literal>--disable-cli</literal> to disable it.
 </para>
 <para>
  As of PHP 4.3.0, the name, location and existence of the CLI/CGI binaries
  will differ depending on how PHP is installed on your system.  By default
  when executing <literal>make</literal>, both the CGI and CLI are built and
  placed as <literal>sapi/cgi/php</literal> and <literal>sapi/cli/php</literal> 
  respectively, in your PHP source directory.  You will note that both are
  named <literal>php</literal>. What happens during <literal>make
  install</literal> depends on your configure 
  line.  If a module SAPI is chosen during configure, such as apxs, or the
  <literal> --disable-cgi</literal> option is used, the CLI is copied to
  <literal>{PREFIX}/bin/php</literal> during <literal>make install</literal>
  otherwise the CGI is placed there.  So, for example, if <literal>--with--apxs
  </literal> is in your configure line then the CLI is copied to
  <literal>{PREFIX}/bin/php</literal> during <literal>make
  install</literal>. If you want to override the installation of the CGI
  binary, use <literal>make install-cli</literal> after <literal>make
  install</literal>.  Alternatively you can specify <literal>--disable-cgi
  </literal> in your configure line.
 </para>
 <para>
  <note>
   <para>
    Because both <literal>--enable-cli</literal> and <literal>
    --enable-cgi</literal> are enabled by default, simply having
    <literal>--enable-cli</literal> in your configure line does
    not necessarily mean the CLI will be copied as <literal>
    {PREFIX}/bin/php</literal> during <literal>make install</literal>.
   </para>
  </note>
 </para>
 <para>
  The windows packages between PHP 4.2.0 and PHP 4.2.3 distributed the CLI as
  <filename>php-cli.exe</filename>, living in the same folder as the CGI
  <filename>php.exe</filename>. Starting with PHP 4.3.0 the windows package
  distributes the CLI as <filename>php.exe</filename> in a separate folder
  named <literal>cli</literal>, so <literal>cli/php.exe</literal>.
  Starting with PHP 5, the CLI is distributed in the main folder, named
  <filename>php.exe</filename>. The CGI version is distributed as
  <filename>php-cgi.exe</filename>.
 </para>
 <para>
  As of PHP 5, a new <filename>php-win.exe</filename> file is distributed.
  This is equal to the CLI version, except that php-win doesn't output
  anything and thus provides no console (no "dos box" appears on the screen). This
  behavior is similar to php-gtk. You should configure with
  <literal>--enable-cli-win32</literal>.
 </para>
 <para>

   <title>What SAPI do I have?</title>
   <para>
    From a shell, typing <literal>php -v</literal> will tell you
    whether <literal>php</literal> is CGI or CLI.  See also the function
    <function>php_sapi_name</function> and the constant <constant>
    PHP_SAPI</constant>.

    A Unix <literal>man</literal>ual page was added in PHP 4.3.2.  You may 
    view this by typing <literal>man php</literal> in your shell environment.

  Remarkable differences of the <literal>CLI SAPI</literal> compared to other
  <literal>SAPI</literal>s:
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Unlike the <literal>CGI SAPI</literal>, no headers are written to the
     output.
    </para>
    <para>
     Though the <literal>CGI SAPI</literal> provides a way to suppress HTTP
     headers, there's no equivalent switch to enable them in the <literal>CLI
     SAPI</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     CLI is started up in quiet mode by default, though the <literal>-q</literal>
     and <literal>--no-header</literal> switches are kept for compatibility so that you can use older CGI scripts.

     There are certain &php.ini; directives which are overridden by the <literal>CLI
     SAPI</literal> because they do not make sense in shell environments:

          It can be quite hard to read the error message in your shell when
          it's cluttered with all those meaningless <literal>HTML</literal>

          It is desired that any output coming from
          <function>print</function>, <function>echo</function> and friends is
          immediately written to the output and not cached in any buffer. You

          Due to endless possibilities of using <literal>PHP</literal> in
          shell environments, the maximum execution time has been set to
          unlimited. Whereas applications written for the web are often
          executed very quickly, shell application tend to have a much
          longer execution time.

          Because this setting is &true; you will always have access to
          <emphasis>argc</emphasis> (number of arguments passed to the 
          application) and <emphasis>argv</emphasis> (array of the actual
          arguments) in the <literal>CLI SAPI</literal>.
         </para>
         <para>
          As of PHP 4.3.0, the <literal>PHP</literal> variables <varname>$argc</varname>
          and <varname>$argv</varname> are registered and filled in with the appropriate 
          values when using the <literal>CLI SAPI</literal>. Prior to this version,
          the creation of these variables behaved as they do in
          <literal>CGI</literal> and <literal>MODULE</literal> versions
          which requires the PHP directive
          <link linkend="ini.register-globals">register_globals</link> to
          be <emphasis>on</emphasis>.  Regardless of version or register_globals
          setting, you can always go through either 
          <link linkend="reserved.variables.server">$_SERVER</link> or 
          <varname>$HTTP_SERVER_VARS</varname>.  Example:

     <para>
      These directives cannot be initialized with another value from the
      configuration file &php.ini; or a custom one (if specified). This is a
      limitation because those default values are applied after all
      configuration files have been parsed. However, their value can be changed
      during runtime (which does not make sense for all of those directives,
      e.g. <link linkend="ini.register-argc-argv">register_argc_argv</link>).

     Given the above, you don't need to open e.g. a stream for

     the stream resource:
     <programlisting role="shell">
<![CDATA[
php -r 'fwrite(STDERR, "stderr\n");'

     </programlisting>
     You do not need to explicitly close these streams, as they are closed

  The <literal>CLI SAPI</literal> has three different ways of getting the
  <literal>PHP</literal> code you want to execute:
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Telling <literal>PHP</literal> to execute a certain file.
    </para>
    <para>
     <screen>
<![CDATA[
php my_script.php

php -f my_script.php
]]>
     </screen>
     Both ways (whether using the <literal>-f</literal> switch or not) execute
     the file <filename>my_script.php</filename>. You can choose any file to
     execute - your <literal>PHP</literal> scripts do not have to end with the
     <filename>.php</filename> extension but can have any name or extension
     you wish.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Pass the <literal>PHP</literal> code to execute directly on the command
     line.

     Special care has to be taken in regards of shell variable substitution and

    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      Read the example carefully, there are no beginning or ending tags! The
      <literal>-r</literal> switch simply does not need them. Using them will
      lead to a parser error.
     </para>
    </note>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Provide the <literal>PHP</literal> code to execute via standard input
     (<literal>stdin</literal>).
    </para>
    <para>
     This gives the powerful ability to dynamically create
     <literal>PHP</literal> code and feed it to the binary, as shown in this
     (fictional) example:
     <screen>
<![CDATA[
$ some_application | some_filter | php | sort -u >final_output.txt
]]>
     </screen>
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  You cannot combine any of the three ways to execute code.
 </para>
 <para>
  Like every shell application, the <literal>PHP</literal> binary
  accepts a number of arguments but your <literal>PHP</literal> script can
  also receive arguments. The number of arguments which can be passed to your script
  is not limited by <literal>PHP</literal> (the shell has a certain size limit
  in the number of characters which can be passed; usually you won't hit this
  limit). The arguments passed to your script are available in the global
  array <literal>$argv</literal>. The zero index always contains the script
  name (which is <literal>-</literal> in case the <literal>PHP</literal> code
  is coming from either standard input or from the command line switch
  <literal>-r</literal>). The second registered global variable is
  <literal>$argc</literal> which contains the number of elements in the
  <literal>$argv</literal> array (<emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> the
  number of arguments passed to the script).
 </para>
 <para>
  As long as the arguments you want to pass to your script do not start with
  the <literal>-</literal> character, there's nothing special to watch out
  for. Passing an argument to your script which starts with a
   <literal>-</literal> will cause trouble because <literal>PHP</literal>
   itself thinks it has to handle it. To prevent this, use the argument list
   separator <literal>--</literal>. After this separator has been parsed by
   <literal>PHP</literal>, every argument following it is passed
   untouched to your script.
 </para>
 <para>
  <screen>
<![CDATA[
# This will not execute the given code but will show the PHP usage
$ php -r 'var_dump($argv);' -h
Usage: php [options] [-f] <file> [args...]
[...]

# This will pass the '-h' argument to your script and prevent PHP from showing it's usage
$ php -r 'var_dump($argv);' -- -h
array(2) {
  [0]=>
  string(1) "-"
  [1]=>
  string(2) "-h"
}
]]>
  </screen>
 </para>
 <para>
  However, there's another way of using <literal>PHP</literal> for shell
  scripting. You can write a script where the first line starts with
  <literal>#!/usr/bin/php</literal>. Following this you can place
  normal <literal>PHP</literal> code included within the <literal>PHP</literal>
  starting and end tags. Once you have set the execution attributes of the file
  appropriately (e.g. <literal>chmod +x test</literal>) your script can be
  executed like a normal shell or perl script:
  <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
var_dump($argv);
?>
]]>
  </programlisting>
  Assuming this file is named <filename>test</filename> in the current
  directory, we can now do the following:
  <screen>
<![CDATA[
$ chmod 755 test
$ ./test -h -- foo
array(4) {
  [0]=>
  string(6) "./test"
  [1]=>
  string(2) "-h"
  [2]=>
  string(2) "--"
  [3]=>
  string(3) "foo"
}
]]>
  </screen>
  As you see, in this case no care needs to be taken when passing parameters
  which start with <literal>-</literal> to your script.

        With this option one can either specify a directory where to look for
        &php.ini; or you can specify a custom <literal>INI</literal> file
        directly (which does not need to be named &php.ini;), e.g.:

        Load Zend extension. If only a filename is given, PHP tries to load
        this extension from the current default library path on your system
        (usually specified <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> on Linux
        systems).  Passing a filename with an absolute path information will
        not use the systems library search path. A relative filename with a
        directory information will tell <literal>PHP</literal> only to try to
        load the extension relative to the current directory.

]]>
         </screen>
         The problem here is that the sh/bash performs variable substitution
         even when using double quotes <literal>"</literal>. Since the
         variable <literal>$foo</literal> is unlikely to be defined, it
         expands to nothing which results in the code passed to
         <literal>PHP</literal> for execution actually reading:
         <screen>
<![CDATA[
$ php -r " = get_defined_constants();"
]]>
         </screen>
         The correct way would be to use single quotes <literal>'</literal>.
         Variables in single-quoted strings are not expanded
         by sh/bash.
         <screen>

         If you are using a shell different from sh/bash, you might experience
         further issues. Feel free to open a bug report or send a mail to
         phpdoc@lists.php.net.

         One can still easily run into troubles when trying to get shell
         variables into the code or using backslashes for escaping. You've
         been warned. <!-- :-) -->

 <!-- OLD DOCUMENTED STARTS
  mfischer, 20020510: I've commented out the start paragraphs of the old
  documentation as it is meant to be replaced by the new one.
 <para>
  The command line options of the PHP executable are useful
  if you would like to debug or test your PHP setup, but they
  can also be handy, if you would like to use PHP for a
  different purpose than web scripting.
 </para>
 <para>
  Note, that you can always direct the output of the PHP
  executable to an external file with the &gt; character,
  so <literal>php -q test.php &gt; test.html</literal> will
  print out the output of <filename>test.php</filename>
  without HTTP headers to the <filename>test.html</filename>
  file in the same directory.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can only use these command line options if you have
  the PHP executable. If you built the server module
  version, and you have no CGI version available on your
  machine, than you have no chance to use these options.
  For Windows users both the PHP executable and the server
  modules are in the binary package, the executable is
  named <filename>php.exe</filename>.
 </para>
 -->
 <para>
  The PHP executable can be used to run PHP scripts absolutely independent
  from the web server. If you are on a Unix system, you should add a special
  first line to your PHP script, and make it executable, so the system will
  know, what program should run the script. On a Windows platform you can
  associate <literal>php.exe</literal> with the double click option of the
  <literal>.php</literal> files, or you can make a batch file to run the
  script through PHP. The first line added to the script to work on Unix won't
  hurt on Windows, so you can write cross platform programs this way. A simple
  example of writing a command line PHP program can be found below.
 </para>
 <para>
  <example>
   <title>Script intended to be run from command line (script.php)</title>
   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
#!/usr/bin/php
<?php

if ($argc != 2 || in_array($argv[1], array('--help', '-help', '-h', '-?'))) {
?>

This is a command line PHP script with one option.

  Usage:
  <?php echo $argv[0]; ?> <option>

  <option> can be some word you would like
  to print out. With the --help, -help, -h,
  or -? options, you can get this help.

<?php
} else {
    echo $argv[1];
}
?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </example>
 </para>
 <para>
  In the script above, we used the special first line to indicate
  that this file should be run by PHP. We work with a CLI version
  here, so there will be no HTTP header printouts. There are two
  variables you can use while writing command line applications with
  PHP: <varname>$argc</varname> and <varname>$argv</varname>. The
  first is the number of arguments plus one (the name of the script
  running). The second is an array containing the arguments, starting
  with the script name as number zero (<varname>$argv[0]</varname>).
 </para>
 <para>
  In the program above we checked if there are less or more than one
  arguments. Also if the argument was <literal>--help</literal>,
  <literal>-help</literal>, <literal>-h</literal> or <literal>-?</literal>,
  we printed out the help message, printing the script name dynamically.
  If we received some other argument we echoed that out.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you would like to run the above script on Unix, you need to
  make it executable, and simply call it as
  <literal>script.php echothis</literal> or
  <literal>script.php -h</literal>. On Windows, you can make a
  batch file for this task:
 </para>
 <para>
  <example>
   <title>Batch file to run a command line PHP script (script.bat)</title>
   <programlisting role="shell">
<![CDATA[
@c:\php\cli\php.exe script.php %1 %2 %3 %4
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </example>
 </para>
 <para>
  Assuming you named the above program
  <filename>script.php</filename>, and you have your
  CLI <filename>php.exe</filename> in
  <filename>c:\php\cli\php.exe</filename> this batch file
  will run it for you with your added options:
  <literal>script.bat echothis</literal> or
  <literal>script.bat -h</literal>.
 </para>
