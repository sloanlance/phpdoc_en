  <title>Safe mode</title>

  <para>
   Safe Mode is an attempt to solve the shared-server security problem. It is
   architecturally incorrect to try to solve this problem at the PHP level, 
   but since the alternatives at the web server and OS levels aren't very 
   realistic, many people, especially ISP's, use safe mode for now. 
  </para>
  <para>
   The configuration directives that control safe mode are: 
   <programlisting role="ini">
safe_mode = Off 
open_basedir = 
safe_mode_exec_dir = 
safe_mode_allowed_env_vars = PHP_ 
safe_mode_protected_env_vars = LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
disable_functions = 
   </programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
   When safe_mode is on, PHP checks to see if the owner of the current script 
   matches the owner of the file to be operated on by a file function. For 
   example: 
   <computeroutput>
-rw-rw-r--    1 rasmus   rasmus       33 Jul  1 19:20 script.php 
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       1116 May 26 18:01 /etc/passwd 
   </computeroutput>
   Running this script.php 
   <programlisting role="php">
&lt;?php
 readfile('/etc/passwd'); 
?&gt;  
   </programlisting>
   results in this error when safe mode is enabled: 
   <computeroutput>
Warning: SAFE MODE Restriction in effect. The script whose uid is 500 is not 
allowed to access /etc/passwd owned by uid 0 in /docroot/script.php on line 2
   </computeroutput>
  </para>
  <para>
   If instead of safe_mode, you set an open_basedir directory then all file 
   operations will be limited to files under the specified directory. For 
   example (Apache httpd.ini example): 
   <programlisting role="ini">
&lt;Directory /docroot&gt; 
php_admin_value open_basedir /docroot 
&lt;/Directory&gt;  
   </programlisting>
   If you run the same script.php with this open_basedir setting then this is 
   the result: 
   <computeroutput>
Warning: open_basedir restriction in effect. File is in wrong directory in 
/docroot/script.php on line 2 
   </computeroutput>
  </para>
  <para>
   You can also disable individual functions. If we add this to our php.ini 
   file: 
   <programlisting role="ini">
disable_functions readfile,system  
   </programlisting>
   Then we get this output: 
   <computeroutput>
Warning: readfile() has been disabled for security reasons in /docroot/script.php on line 2 
   </computeroutput>
  </para>
