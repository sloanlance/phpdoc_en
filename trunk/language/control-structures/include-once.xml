 <title><function>include_once</function></title>
 <para>
  The <function>include_once</function> statement includes and evaluates
  the specified file during the execution of the script.
  This is a behavior similar to the <function>include</function> statement,
  with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already
  been included, it will not be included again.  As the name suggests,
  it will be included just once.
 </para>
 <para>
  <function>include_once</function> should be used in cases where
  the same file might be included and evaluated more than once during a
  particular execution of a script, and you want to be sure that it is
  included exactly once to avoid problems with function redefinitions,
  variable value reassignments, etc.
 </para>
 <para>
  For more examples on using <function>require_once</function> and
  <function>include_once</function>, look at the
  <link xlink:href="&url.php.pear;">PEAR</link> code included in the latest
  PHP source code distributions.
 </para>
 <para>
  Return values are the same as with <function>include</function>. If the file
  was already included, this function returns &true;

    <function>include_once</function> was added in PHP 4.0.1

    Be aware, that the behaviour of <function>include_once</function>
    and <function>require_once</function> may not be what you expect
    on a non case sensitive operating system (such as Windows).
    <example>
     <title><function>include_once</function> is case insensitive on Windows</title>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
include_once "a.php"; // this will include a.php
include_once "A.php"; // this will include a.php again on Windows! (PHP 4 only)
?>
]]>
      </programlisting>
    </example>
    This behaviour changed in PHP 5 - the path is normalized first so that
    <filename>C:\PROGRA~1\A.php</filename> is realized the same as
    <filename>C:\Program Files\a.php</filename> and the file is included just once.
