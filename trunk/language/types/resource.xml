 <title>Resource</title>
  
 <para>
  A resource is a special variable, holding a reference to an external resource.
  Resources are created and used by special functions. See the
  <link linkend="resource">appendix</link> for a listing of all these functions
  and the corresponding resource types.
 </para>
  
 <note>
  <simpara>
   The resource type was introduced in PHP 4

 <sect2 xml:id="language.types.resource.casting">
  <title>Converting to resource</title>
  
  <para>
   As resource types hold special handlers to opened files, database
   connections, image canvas areas and the like, you cannot convert any value to
   a resource.
  </para>

 <sect2 xml:id="language.types.resource.self-destruct">
  <title>Freeing resources</title>
  
  <para>
   Due to the reference-counting system introduced with PHP 4's Zend Engine, it
   is automatically detected when a resource is no longer referred to (just like
   Java). When this is the case, all resources that were in use for this resource
   are made free by the garbage collector. For this reason, it is rarely ever
   necessary to free the memory manually by using some free_result function.
  </para>

  <note>
   <simpara>
    Persistent database links are special, they are <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    destroyed by the garbage collector. See also the section about
    <link linkend="features.persistent-connections">persistent
    connections</link>.
