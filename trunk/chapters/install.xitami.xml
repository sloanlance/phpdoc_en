     <title>Important for CGI users</title>
     <para>
      When running PHP as CGI with IIS, PWS, OmniHTTPD or Xitami,
      you MUST set the <link linkend="ini.cgi.force-redirect">
      cgi.force_redirect</link> directive to <literal>0</literal>.
      It defaults to <literal>1</literal> so be sure the directive
      isn't commented out (with a <literal>;</literal>).
     </para>
     <para>
      It's important that you're 100% sure that &php.ini; is
      being read by PHP.  To test this, make a call to
      <function>phpinfo</function> and near the top will be a
      listing called <literal>Configuration File (php.ini)</literal>.
      This will tell you where PHP is looking for &php.ini; and
      whether or not it's being read.  If just a PATH exists
      than it's not being read and you should put your &php.ini;
      there.  If &php.ini; is included with the PATH than it is
      being read.
     </para>

        and click on Configuration.
