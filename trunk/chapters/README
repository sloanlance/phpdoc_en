Please do not modify and/or put effort into translating the install.*.xml
files and the config.xml file, since these are going to move to the install
folder, get further split, and then their content will be reorganized. So
putting time and effort now to translate these files is worthless. Also it
would be nice if you would not modify these files, since the install folder
files will replace these, and modification is expected to be done there.
