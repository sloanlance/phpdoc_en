      Apache 2.0 <literal>SAPI</literal>-support started with PHP 4.2.0.
      PHP 4.2.3 works with Apache 2.0.39, don't use any other version of Apache with
      PHP 4.2.3. However, the recommended setup is to use PHP 4.3.0 or later with
      the most recent version of Apache2.

     <simpara>
      All mentioned versions of <literal>PHP</literal> will work still with
      Apache 1.3.x.

    <title>PHP and Apache 2 on Linux</title>
    <para>
     Download the most recent version of <ulink url= "&url.apache;">
     Apache 2.0</ulink> and a fitting PHP version from the above mentioned places.
     This quick guide covers only the basics to get started with Apache 2.0
     and <literal>PHP</literal>. For more information read the
     <ulink url="&url.apache2.docs;">Apache Documentation</ulink>.
     The version numbers have been omitted here, to ensure the
     instructions are not incorrect. You will need to replace the 'NN' here with the
     correct values from your files.
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>
      Installation Instructions (Apache 2 Shared Module Version)
     </title>
     <screen>
<![CDATA[
1.  gzip -d httpd-2_0_NN.tar.gz
2.  tar xvf httpd-2_0_NN.tar
3.  gunzip php-NN.tar.gz
4.  tar -xvf php-NN.tar
5.  cd httpd-2_0_NN
6.  ./configure --enable-so
7.  make
8.  make install

    Now you have Apache 2.0.NN available under /usr/local/apache2,
    configured with loadable module support and the standard MPM prefork.
    To test the installation use your normal procedure for starting
    the Apache server, e.g.:
    /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
    and stop the server to go on with the configuration for PHP:
    /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl stop.

9.  cd ../php-NN

10. Now, configure your PHP.  This is where you customize your PHP
    with various options, like which extensions will be enabled.  Do a
    ./configure --help for a list of available options.  In our example
    we'll do a simple configure with Apache 2 and MySQL support.  Your
    path to apxs may differ, in fact, the binary may even be named apxs2 on
    your system. 
    
      ./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs --with-mysql

11. make
12. make install

    If you decide to change your configure options after installation,
    you only need to repeat the last three steps. You only need to
    restart apache for the new module to take effect. A recompile of
    Apache is not needed.
                
    Note that unless told otherwise, 'make install' will also install PEAR,
    various PHP tools such as phpize, install the PHP CLI, and more.
    
13. Setup your php.ini 
    
    cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php.ini
          
    You may edit your .ini file to set PHP options.  If you prefer having
    php.ini in another location, use --with-config-file-path=/some/path in
    step 10.
    
    If you instead choose php.ini-recommended, be certain to read the list
    of changes within, as they affect how PHP behaves.

14. Edit your httpd.conf to load the PHP module.  The path on the right hand
    side of the LoadModule statement must point to the path of the PHP
    module on your system.  The make install from above may have already
    added this for you, but be sure to check.

    For PHP 4:
  
      LoadModule php4_module libexec/libphp4.so
      
    For PHP 5:
    
      LoadModule php5_module libexec/libphp5.so
 
15. Tell Apache to parse certain extensions as PHP.  For example,
    let's have Apache parse the .php extension as PHP.  You could
    have any extension(s) parse as PHP by simply adding more, with
    each separated by a space.  We'll add .phtml to demonstrate.
            
      AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml
                  
    It's also common to setup the .phps extension to show highlighted PHP
    source, this can be done with:
    
      AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
 
16. Use your normal procedure for starting the Apache server, e.g.:
   
      /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

     </example>
    <para>
     Following the steps above you will have a running Apache 2.0 with
     support for <literal>PHP</literal> as <literal>SAPI</literal> module.
     Of course there are many more configuration options available for both,
     Apache and <literal>PHP</literal>. For more information use
     <command>./configure --help</command> in the corresponding source
     tree. In case you wish to build a multithreaded version of Apache 2.0
     you must overwrite the standard MPM-Module <filename>prefork</filename>
     either with <filename>worker</filename> or <filename>perchild</filename>.
     To do so append to your configure line in step 6 above either the option
     <option role="configure">--with-mpm=worker</option> or
     <option role="configure">--with-mpm=perchild</option>. Take care about
     the consequences and understand what you are doing. For more information
     read the Apache documentation about the <ulink url="&url.apache2.mpm;">
     MPM-Modules</ulink>.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      To build a multithreaded version of Apache your system must support threads.
      This also implies to build <literal>PHP</literal> with experimental
      Zend Thread Safety (ZTS). Therefore not all extensions might be available.
      The recommended setup is to build Apache with the standard
      <filename>prefork</filename> MPM-Module.

     Windows specific notes</ulink> for Apache 2.0.
    </para>
    <warning>
     <para>
      Apache 2.0 is designed to run on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 or
      Windows XP. At this time, support for Windows 9x is incomplete.
      Apache 2.0 is not expected to work on those platforms at this time.
     </para>

    <para>
     Download the most recent version of <ulink url= "&url.apache;">
     Apache 2.0</ulink> and a fitting PHP version from the above mentioned places.
     Follow the <link linkend="install.windows.manual">Manual Installation Steps</link>
     and come back to go on with the integration of <literal>PHP</literal>
     and Apache.
    </para>
    <para>
     There are two ways to set up <literal>PHP</literal> to work with
     Apache 2.0 on Windows. One is to use the CGI binary the other is to
     use the Apache module DLL. In either case you need to stop the Apache
     server, and edit your &httpd.conf; to configure Apache
     to work with <literal>PHP</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     You need to insert these three lines to your Apache &httpd.conf;
     configuration file to set up the <emphasis>CGI binary</emphasis>:
     <example>
      <title>PHP and Apache 2.0 as CGI</title>
       <programlisting role="apache">
<![CDATA[
ScriptAlias /php/ "c:/php/"

Action application/x-httpd-php "/php/php.exe"
]]>
       </programlisting>
     </example>
    </para>
    <para>
     If you would like to use <literal>PHP</literal> as a module in Apache 2.0,
     be sure to move <filename>php4ts.dll</filename> for PHP 4, or
     <filename>php5ts.dll</filename> for PHP 5, to
     <filename>winnt/system32</filename> (for Windows NT/2000) or
     <filename>windows/system32</filename> (for Windows XP),
     overwriting any older file. You need to insert these two lines to your
     Apache &httpd.conf; configuration file to set up the
     <emphasis>PHP-Module</emphasis> for Apache 2.0:
     <example>
      <title>PHP and Apache 2.0 as Module</title>

    <note>
     <simpara>
      Remember to substitute the <filename>c:/php/</filename> for your actual
      path to <literal>PHP</literal> in the above examples. Take care to use
      either <filename>php4apache2.dll</filename> or 
      <filename>php5apache2.dll</filename> in your LoadModule directive and
      <emphasis>not</emphasis><filename>php4apache.dll</filename> or 
      <filename>php5apache.dll</filename> as the latter ones are designed to
      run with <link linkend="install.apache.windows">Apache 1.3.x</link>.
     </simpara>
    </note>
    <warning>
     <simpara>
      Don't mix up your installation with dll files from
      <emphasis>different PHP versions </emphasis>. You have the only choice
      to use the dll's and extensions that ship with your downloaded PHP version.
