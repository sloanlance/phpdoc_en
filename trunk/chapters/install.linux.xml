    <title>Using Packages</title>
    <simpara>
     Many Linux distributions have some sort of package installation
     system, such as RPM. This can assist in setting up a standard
     configuration, but if you need to have a different set of features
     (such as a secure server, or a different database driver), you may
     need to build PHP and/or your webserver. If you are unfamiliar
     with building and compiling your own software, it is worth
     checking to see whether somebody has already built a packaged
     version of PHP with the features you need.
