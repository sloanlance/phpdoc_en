     These functions interface the CCVS API, allowing you to work
     directly with CCVS from your PHP scripts.  CCVS is <ulink
     url="&url.redhat;">RedHat's</ulink> solution to the "middle-man"
     in credit card processing.  It lets you directly address the
     credit card clearing houses via your *nix box and a modem.  Using
     the CCVS module for PHP, you can process credit cards directly
     through CCVS via your PHP Scripts.  The following references will
     outline the process.

      CCVS has been discontinued by Red Hat and there are no plans
      to issue further keys or support contracts. Those looking for a 
      replacement can consider 
      <ulink url="&url.redhat.mcve;">MCVE by Main Street Softworks</ulink>
      as a potential replacement. It is similar in design and has documented
      PHP support!

     To enable CCVS Support in PHP, first verify your CCVS installation
     directory.  You will then need to configure PHP with the <option
     role="configure">--with-ccvs</option> option. If you use this
     option without specifying the path to your CCVS installation, PHP
     will attempt to look in the default CCVS Install location
     (/usr/local/ccvs). If CCVS is in a non-standard location, run
     configure with: <option
     role="configure">--with-ccvs=$ccvs_path</option>, where $ccvs_path
     is the path to your CCVS installation.  Please note that CCVS
     support requires that $ccvs_path/lib and $ccvs_path/include exist,
     and include cv_api.h under the include directory and libccvs.a
     under the lib directory.
    </para>
    <para>
     Additionally, a ccvsd process will need to be running for the
     configurations you intend to use in your PHP scripts. You will
     also need to make sure the PHP Processes are running under the
     same user as your CCVS was installed as (e.g. if you installed
     CCVS as user 'ccvs', your PHP processes must run as 'ccvs' as
     well.)

     maintains slightly outdated but still useful documentation at
