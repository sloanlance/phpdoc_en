    The default is to build PHP as a CGI program.  This creates a
    commandline interpreter, which can be used for CGI processing, or
    for non-web-related PHP scripting.  If you are running a web
    server PHP has module support for, you should generally go for
    that solution for performance reasons.  However, the CGI version
    enables users to run different PHP-enabled pages under
    different user-ids.

    As of PHP 4.3.0, some important additions have happened to PHP.  A new
    SAPI named CLI also exists and it has the same name as the CGI binary.
    What is installed at <literal>{PREFIX}/bin/php</literal> depends on your
    configure line and this is described in detail in the manual section
    named <link linkend="features.commandline">Using PHP from the command
    line</link>. For further details please read that section of the manual.

     If you have built PHP as a CGI program, you may test your build
     by typing <command>make test</command>.  It is always a good idea
     to test your build.  This way you may catch a problem with PHP on
     your platform early instead of having to struggle with it later.

    <title>Benchmarking</title>
    <simpara>
     If you have built PHP 3 as a CGI program, you may benchmark your
     build by typing <command>make bench</command>. Note that if 
     &safemode; is on by default, the benchmark may not be able to finish if
     it takes longer then the 30 seconds allowed. This is because the
     <function>set_time_limit</function> can not be used in 
     &safemode;. Use the <link
      linkend="ini.max-execution-time">max_execution_time</link>
     configuration setting to control this time for your own
     scripts. <command>make bench</command> ignores the <link
      linkend="configuration.file">configuration file</link>.
    </simpara>
    <note>
     <simpara>
        <command>make bench</command> is only available for PHP 3.
