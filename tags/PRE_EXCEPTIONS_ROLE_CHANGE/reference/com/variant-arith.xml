<para>
 As with all the variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this function
 can be either a PHP native type (integer, string, floating point, boolean or
 &null;), or an instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class.  PHP native types
 will be converted to variants using the same rules as found in the constructor
 for the <xref linkend="class.variant"/> class.  COM and DOTNET objects
 will have the value of their default property taken and used as the variant value.
</para>
<para>
 The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named
 functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions, consult
 the MSDN library.  The PHP functions are named slightly differently; for example
 variant_add() in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in the MSDN documentation.
